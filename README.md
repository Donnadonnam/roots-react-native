# roots-react-native
Work done by Snapbrillia participants to get our complex mobile app replicated into a simpler UI-only repo so that we can do future Gigs to iterate quickly to change the front-end.

## Requirements:
* Must be able to run it with yarn on android, ios, and web
* Must avoid any libraries that are non-UI libraries
* It should follow the mocks provided
